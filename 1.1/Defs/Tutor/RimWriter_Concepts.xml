    <helpText>Pawns can use the typewriting table to give themselves joy and reduce stress. If Call of Cthulhu is enabled, this station will also reduce the severity of insanity at a faster rate. Pawns can also create journal items. Currently, these are rudimentary, and can be destroyed. They will be expanded upon later.</helpText>
